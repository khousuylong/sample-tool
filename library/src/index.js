//export { default as Button } from "components/Button";
export { default as AdminSetting } from "components/admin/setting";

//import AdminSetting from 'components/admin/setting'
//import Client from 'components/client/client'
//import MeasureTool from 'components/l-libs/lPlugin'

//export {AdminSetting}//, Client, MeasureTool}

// alternative, more concise syntax for named exports
// export { default as Foo } from './Foo'

// you can optionally also set a default export for your module
//export default { AdminSetting }//, Client, MeasureTool }
//export { default as AdminSetting } from 'components/admin/setting'
